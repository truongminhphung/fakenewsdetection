# Fake News Detection

## Project Description

- In 21 century, every day we all access a lot of information on the internet. There is a lot of fake news in the Internet and it is hard to recognize what is valuable and useless one.
- So i decided to build a fake news recognition model to help me solve that pain matter.
- I took Fake and real news dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) to build my own model
- I applied LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and pretrained embedding glovetwitter27b100dtxt to accomplish my project.
